"Given above SurveyDesign how to calculate Yates-Grundy variance estimate of an arbitrary statistics using Horvitz Thompson estimator"

"Yates-Grundy variance estimate is a variance estimate for the Horvitz-Thompson estimator that accounts for the correlation between the sampling probabilities of different observations.

Here's an example of a function in Julia that calculates the Yates-Grundy variance estimate of an arbitrary statistic using the Horvitz-Thompson estimator:"

using LinearAlgebra

function yates_grundy(design::SurveyDesign, statistic::Function)
    # calculate the Horvitz-Thompson estimator
    ht_estimator = sum(statistic.(design.data[!, :]) .* design.data[!, design.weights])
    # calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities
    p_var_cov = cov(design.data[!, design.weights] ./ design.data[!, design.popsize])
    # calculate the Yates-Grundy variance estimate
    yg_var = ht_estimator^2 * trace(p_var_cov)
    return yg_var
end

"The above function takes in a SurveyDesign object and a function (statistic) that calculates the arbitrary statistic of interest for each observation in the data. It first calculates the Horvitz-Thompson estimator of the statistic by taking the product of the statistic for each observation with its corresponding weight and summing over all observations.
Then it calculates the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities by taking the covariance of the weights column of the data divided by the population size column of the data. Finally, it calculates the Yates-Grundy variance estimate of the statistic by squaring the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and multiplying it with the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities.

It is worth noting that this function assumes that the sampling is done independently and with replacement, which is not true in some complex sampling designs like multi-stage sampling. In that case, the variance estimate would have to be done with the help of replicate weights and the estimation of the variance will be different."

" Modifying the above function for multi-stage sampling would require additional information about the sampling probabilities and the sampling design at each stage. Here's an example of how the function could be modified to account for multi-stage sampling:"
function yates_grundy_multistage(design::SurveyDesign, statistic::Function, stage_probs::Vector{Vector{Float64}}, design_matrix::Matrix{Float64})
    # calculate the Horvitz-Thompson estimator
    ht_estimator = sum(statistic.(design.data[!, :]) .* design.data[!, design.weights])
    # calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities
    p_var_cov = var_cov_multistage(design.data[!, design.weights], design.data[!, design.popsize], stage_probs, design_matrix)
    # calculate the Yates-Grundy variance estimate
    yg_var = ht_estimator^2 * trace(p_var_cov)
    return yg_var
end

"This function takes in additional inputs, which are:

stage_probs : A vector of vectors containing the sampling probabilities at each stage of sampling.
design_matrix : A matrix indicating the design of multi-stage sampling, where element i,j represents the probability of selecting unit i from stage j.
The var_cov_multistage function calculates the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities by taking into account the sampling probabilities and design of multi-stage sampling.
This function can be implemented using matrix algebra and the design matrix, but it depends on the specific details of the multi-stage sampling design.

It is important to keep in mind that"

"For multi-stage sampling, the variance estimate of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator using the Yates-Grundy method needs to take into account the correlation between the sampling probabilities at different stages of sampling.
Here's an example of how the above function can be modified to account for multi-stage sampling:"

using LinearAlgebra

function yates_grundy_multistage(design::SurveyDesign, statistic::Function, stages::Vector{Symbol})
    # calculate the Horvitz-Thompson estimator
    ht_estimator = sum(statistic.(design.data[!, :]) .* design.data[!, design.weights])
    # calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities at each stage
    p_var_cov = [cov(design.data[!, stage]./design.data[!, design.popsize]) for stage in stages]
    # calculate the overall variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities
    p_var_cov_overall = sum(p_var_cov,dims=1)
    # calculate the Yates-Grundy variance estimate
    yg_var = ht_estimator^2 * trace(p_var_cov_overall)
    return yg_var
end

"The above function takes in a SurveyDesign object, a function (statistic) that calculates the arbitrary statistic of interest for each observation in the data and a vector of symbols(stages) that indicate the sampling stages. It first calculates the Horvitz-Thompson estimator of the statistic in the same way as before. Then it calculates the variance-covariance matrix of the sampling probabilities at each stage by taking the covariance of the sampling probabilities at each stage"
